## DRY Code - Use functions for duplicate code

As a developer
I want to ensure that I am using functions to elimate repeated code
So that I can ensure the code is DRY and more readable

- Implement functions on repeated code blocks



## Review variable names and adjust

As a developer
I want to ensure that my variable names are appropriate
So that my code is readable and can be understood when worked on at a later duplicate

- Review and adjust variable names where necessary


## Implement validation

As a product owner
I want to ensure that user input meets the parameters required by the application
So that any errors can be avoided if the unaccepted value is provided

- Ensure the user only inputs Alpha Characters when input is requested
- Ensure that invalid responses are handled appropriately (Should ask user to re-enter response)



## Display user's guesses

As a user
I want to see what characters I have already guessed
So I can ensure I am not guessing the same character twice

- Create a command to display the user's guesses


## Prevent user from guessing same letter again

As a product owner
I want to prevent the game from processing a letter that has previously been guessed
So that the player doesn't receive additional incorrect guesses for duplicate guesses

- Ensure that duplicate guesses are handled appropriately (Should display a message, and ask for the user to guess again)


## Give a user a list of commands they can user

As a product owner
I want the user to be aware of additoinal commands they can user
so they can view information that may be availble to them

- Implement text to show a list of avaiable commands

## Dispaly guesses left with command
